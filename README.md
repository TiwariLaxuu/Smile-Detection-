# Smile-Detection
This is the turorial of Smile Detection using powerful computer vision tool OpenCv. Here, we detect smile of a person by using Haar like features algorithm. When person smile, it automatically detect smile and show in a red box. 
## OpenCv
It is a highly optimized with focus on real-time application. It is mainly used for Image Processing. We use OpenCv library to detect face and smile of a person. It has various algorithm like 
1. The Viola-Jones Algorithm
2. Haar-Like Feature
3. Integral Image

Here edge feature is used to find out Eye and Nose and Mouth(smile) by line feature. Haarcascde file contain assigned weight of each feature while training data.
